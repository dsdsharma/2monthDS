# Day_3 -- The Hamming Distance Problem

The Hamming distance between two strings of equal length is the number of positions at which the corresponding symbols are different.

It measures the minimum number of substitutions required to change one string into the other or the minimum number of errors that could have transformed one string into the other.

**Question**- Given 2 strings, we will find the number of positions at which the corresponding characters are different.

*** Example ***

```
The hamming distance between
- "karolin" and "kathrin" is 3
- "karolin" and "kerstin" is 3
- 1011101 and 1001001 is 2
- 2173896 and 2233796 is 3
